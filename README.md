# Melbourne-Suburbs-Housing-Price-Estimator

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Melbourne using data science and machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data wrangling, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building, aiming to identify the key factors influencing property prices.

# Objectives
- Explore and clean the Melbourne Housing dataset.
- Perform feature selection and encoding.
- Train machine learning models for price prediction.
- Evaluate and compare model performance.

# Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visualisation: Matplotlib & Seaborn for insights
- Machine Lerning Modeling: Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest

# Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning — Handle missing values and outliers.
2. Feature Engineering — Convert categorical variables and normalise numerical features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Examine relationships between price and factors like location, rooms, and type.
4. Model Training & Testing — Compare multiple regression models for accuracy and interpretability.
5. Prediction Function — A ready-to-use model that predicts housing prices based on input parameters.

# Results
The Random Forest Regressor achieved the most reliable results, balancing accuracy and generalisation. The model was able to predict house prices with strong performance on unseen data.

# Note
This project is purely for educational and analytical purposes. The dataset used is publicly available, and all data handling complies with ethical data use guidelines.
